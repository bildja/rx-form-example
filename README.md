# RxJS Form Example

The task is to make the submit button red when the form is valid (filled) after user being idle for 6 sec.

If the form became invalid the button shouldn't get red color.

If the form was submit, the button shouldn't get red color.

If the button already got red color it should be removed after submiting the form or making it invalid.
